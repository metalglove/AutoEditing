# Auto Editor Roadmap — CoD Sniper Montages in VEGAS Pro 20

Self-contained plan for continuing this work in any session. Written 2026-07-19.
Companion doc: [vegas-scripting-effects-api.md](vegas-scripting-effects-api.md)
(verified VEGAS 20 scripting API research with sources; UNVERIFIED items are
marked there explicitly).

## Context — where the project stands

Pipeline (working, verified via harness against real clips):
**parse → beat detection → shot detection → plan → build timeline**

- Test data: `C:\Users\mario\Videos\edit` — 10 real MWIII clips + song
  `Traveller - Never Cared (2002).mp3` (detected 94.6 BPM, first beat 0.488s).
- `Core/Domain/Audio/` (AudioLoader, BeatDetector, ShotDetector) and
  `Core/Domain/Editing/MontagePlanner.cs` are deliberately **VEGAS-free** and are
  compiled directly into `Tools/AnalysisHarness` (net48 console) for testing
  without VEGAS. Harness also has `--debug-tempo <song>` and
  `--debug-shots <clip>` tuning commands.
- `TimelineBuilder`/`MontageOrchestrator` execute the plan in VEGAS
  (tracks, events, take offsets). Compiles; needs a first smoke run in VEGAS.
- `EffectsApplier`: `ApplyVelocityEnvelope` is real (Phase 1, unverified in
  VEGAS); nametags/color/transitions are still placeholders (log-only).
- Naming: `Player - Game - Map - GUN TYPE [SEQ] [(notes)].mp4`. Placement is
  marked ONLY by `[OPENER]`/`[CLOSER]` filename prefixes. Type words like
  "Ender" (= game-ending kill, e.g. "nosc ender") are just clip type — do NOT
  infer placement from them (this was a bug, fixed).
- Build: `dotnet build Core/Core.csproj` and `dotnet build Tools/AnalysisHarness`
  from the `AutoEditing/` folder. Style gate: **no `var` keyword anywhere**
  (pre-build script fails the build). NAudio 2.2.1 DLLs are hint-path referenced
  from `AutoEditing/packages/` (gitignored; repopulate from
  `%USERPROFILE%\.nuget\packages` if missing).

Known limitation: ShotDetector finds loud shots/impacts, not kills — clips with
lots of firing over-count (e.g. a "Triple" clip detecting 12 transients). Only
the first-shot alignment is currently reliable. Phase 4 fixes this.

## The API fact that shapes everything

**Velocity envelopes never change `VideoEvent.Length`.** The event consumes
source media equal to the integral of the velocity curve over its fixed
timeline length. There is no built-in compensation API. Therefore:

- Timeline slot lengths stay beat-quantized (set by the planner, as today).
- The planner must solve "which source window + speed profile makes the kill
  land on beat N" by integrating the profile (trapezoid integrals for
  piecewise-linear velocity). Pure math → unit-test it in the harness.

API (verified): `Envelope env = new Envelope(EnvelopeType.Velocity);`
`videoEvent.Envelopes.Add(env);` points are `EnvelopePoint(Timecode, double y,
CurveType)` with y as a speed fraction: `1.0` = 100%, `0.0` = freeze,
negative = reverse, max `10.0`.

## Phase 0 — VEGAS smoke test (user, ~10 min)

Build, copy `Core.dll` to the VEGAS scripts folder (see README / `.vscode/copy-dll.ps1`),
run on the test folder. Verify: clips appear at planned beat positions and each
clip's **source window** matches the harness plan output (take offsets working).
First place to look if source positions are wrong: `Take.Offset` semantics in
`TimelineBuilder.PlaceClip`.

## Phase 1 — Velocity time-remapping (quickscope feel) ← IMPLEMENTED (needs VEGAS run)

Status 2026-07-19: items 1 and 2 implemented; verify with
`AnalysisHarness.exe --test-speed` (synthetic self-tests, no media needed) and
then a VEGAS smoke run (which also covers Phase 0).

1. **Planner** — DONE. `SpeedProfile` (`Core/Domain/Editing/SpeedProfile.cs`,
   VEGAS-free) holds piecewise-linear velocity points in event-local timeline
   time with trapezoid `SourceConsumedAt` and quadratic-solve
   `EventTimeForSource` (inverse). `MontagePlanner` builds the default profile
   (1.2× lead-in, smooth ramp over the last beat into a 0.35× dip, kill frame
   at the dip ON the beat, back to 1× a beat later; enders/multis get a
   beat-long y=0 freeze + half-beat recovery) and solves the source offset so
   the kill's source frame is consumed exactly at the kill beat. Fallbacks:
   solve a slower lead-in (floor 0.5×) when the kill is near the clip start;
   shrink the slot whole beats when source runs out after the kill; flat
   profile when neither works. `ClipPlacement.TimelineKillTimesSeconds` now
   maps kills through the profile inverse. Harness plan output shows
   `speed=warped(...)`/`speed=flat` per placement.
2. **EffectsApplier** — DONE (code written, NOT yet run in VEGAS).
   `ApplyVelocityEnvelope(videoEvent, profile)` writes the envelope via the
   verified `new Envelope(EnvelopeType.Velocity)` pattern, adjusting the
   default point at 0 instead of duplicating it. Curve choice: only
   `Linear`/`Smooth` are used — VEGAS's Smooth is a symmetric ease-in/out, so
   its per-segment integral equals the linear trapezoid and the planner's
   source math stays exact at every point boundary; Fast/Slow are asymmetric
   and would shift the kill frame off its source position, so they are
   deliberately not used. Planner also keeps 0.1s of source in reserve per
   warped event in case VEGAS's curve integrals differ marginally.
3. **Frame-rate note**: 60fps source at 0.35× ≈ 21 unique fps — fine at 30fps
   render, visible at 60. Keep dips short (2–4 beats). Later option (free, no
   plugin): ffmpeg `minterpolate` pre-render for hero clips.

## Phase 2 — Impact effects, all procedural, no plugins

Gate this phase on the **probe script**: add a mode that dumps
`vegas.VideoFX` / `vegas.Generators` / `vegas.Transitions` plugin names + UIDs
and the `VideoMotion` keyframe API surface (reflection) to the log. One VEGAS
run resolves every UNVERIFIED item in the API doc; hardcode nothing before that.

- **Punch-in zoom on beats**: `VideoEvent.VideoMotion` keyframes — scale ~108%
  for 2–3 frames on the beat, return. (Exact keyframe/vertex API: see probe.)
- **Camera shake at kills**: same API — burst of small random position/rotation
  keyframes over ~8 frames, decaying amplitude. Procedural, no BCC.
- **White flash on cuts**: 2–3 frame Solid Color generator events with fades on
  an overlay track (generator UID via probe).
- **Transitions on section changes**: verified pattern
  `videoEvent.FadeIn.Transition = new Effect(plugInNode)` over an event overlap.
  Use sparingly (e.g. every 8th cut / section boundaries), not every cut.

## Phase 3 — Polish

- **Nametags**: "Titles & Text" generator; its `Text` OFX parameter takes **RTF**
  — stage the string in a `System.Windows.Forms.RichTextBox`, assign `.Rtf` to
  the `OFXStringParameter.Value`. Show player + gun + type for ~2s per clip.
- **Grade**: track-level Color Curves, or VEGAS LUT Filter with a user `.cube`.
- **Render button**: verified `Renderer`/`RenderTemplate`/`RenderArgs` +
  `Vegas.Render()` pattern → queue an MP4 render from the script UI.

## Free plugins — conclusion: skip (researched, mostly dead ends)

- HitFilm Ignite Express: dead (site gone; broken on modern VEGAS).
- RGBurst / DataStorm (RGB-split/glitch OFX): paid.
- VEGAS 20 bundle (Continuum Primatte Studio): a keyer; not montage material.
- Everything in Phases 1–3 needs zero plugins. Optional later experiment: fake
  chromatic aberration with 3 stacked channel-isolated copies offset a few px.

## Phase 4 — Detection v2: per-gun sound templates + hitmarker matching

User has offered to record gun sounds. Design:

- Templates in e.g. `C:\Users\mario\Videos\edit\templates\<GUN> 01.wav`
  (filename gives the gun; 2–3 variants per gun: indoor/outdoor). The parser
  already knows each clip's gun → match only that gun's templates.
- Keep current transient detector as a **high-recall candidate finder** (lower
  thresholds), then **verify** each candidate: compare log-spectral envelopes of
  attack + ~150ms early decay against the template (cosine similarity), max over
  templates. Ignore the reverb tail — that's what varies indoor vs outdoor; the
  attack spectrum is the stable signature. Raw waveform cross-correlation would
  NOT be robust; spectral-envelope matching is.
- **Bigger win — ask user for MWIII hitmarker / kill-confirmed UI sounds**:
  game-UI audio is identical every time (acoustics-independent) and marks
  KILLS, not shots. This fixes over-counting directly and enables per-kill beat
  sync (every kill on a beat via Phase 1 velocity dips, not just the first).
- Tuning workflow: `--debug-shots` baselines are recorded in
  `.claude` project memory (shot-detection-tuning); current constants:
  RMS 40ms/10ms, attack lookback 80ms (must exceed RMS window smear),
  peak > 3.5× median, > 0.30× max, rise ≥ 35% over 80ms, merge 0.35s.

## Phase 5 — Musical structure

- Cut on **downbeats** (bars = 4 beats), not arbitrary beats.
- Song sections via energy over 4-bar windows: intro/build/drop. Place best
  clips (most kills, `7mult`, `ender` types) at drops; opener clip at intro.
- Weight slot length by clip type; consider "same game" sequence adjacency.

## Execution model

Order: **0 → 1 → probe → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5**.

Delegation (user preference): orchestrate with the main session; delegate
implementation/research to subagents — the user wants the **codex plugin**
(`openai/codex-plugin-cc`) used for task delegation once installed (install via
`/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc` in the interactive CLI; it was
not available in the previous environment). Until then: general-purpose
subagents with harness-verified acceptance criteria.

Verification per phase: harness output for anything VEGAS-free; one quick VEGAS
run by the user for timeline/effect changes (only the user can see the
timeline). Never mark VEGAS-side work verified without that run.
